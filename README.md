# FourierTransform.py
Computing the Fourier-coefficients of a signal, and using the first ones for reconstructing it using an interactive slider

# Dialtones.py
Given is a signal consisting of different signals, coming from pressing different numbers on a cell phone. The Goal is to find out, which numbers have been dialed,

First we divide the signal into 6 parts, one for every tone.
Then we apply the DFT to look at the signals. Then we can conclude, wich number has been dialed.
